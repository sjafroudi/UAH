				"Site": "Central Experimental Farm",
				"Location": "Ottawa, ON",
				"Size": "4.2 km² ",
				"Heritage Designation": "National Historic Site",
				"Geography and Climate": "The Central Experimental Farm is located in the urban landscape of downtown Ottawa which is primarily underlain by bedrock. This particular site, however, was intentionally sought out for its rich soils. Harsh winters and humid summers are typical in this continental climatic region. Ottawa is located in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest region which is dominated by unevenly aged hardwood forests as well as coniferous trees and deciduous broad-leaved species.",
				"Urban Integration": "The Central Experimental Farm is located in the urban core of Ottawa.",
				"Main Products": "Crops: Wheat, Corn, Oats, Soybeans; Ornamental Garden: Heritage Roses, Lilacs, Peonies, Irises and Daylilies, Perennials; Arboretum: Magnolias, Crabapple Trees, Hostas, Shrubs",
				"Scale of Operation": "The Central Experimental Farm leads crop development from Manitoba to Prince Edward Island alongside other areas of research. Research at the CEF supports Canadian agriculture.",
				"History": "Located in the urban core of Canada’s capital city, the Central Experimental Farm was created in 1886 with the intention of creating profitable new agricultural methods agriculture in Canada. At its conception, it was designated as the central research station for the Department of Agriculture who selected the rectangular parcel of land due to its richness of soil types, access to rail transport, and proximity to land and water. The CEF is situated 3 kilometers away from Canada’s legislative core, Parliament Hill, which was built in 1859. The CEF continues to operate as a site of research and agricultural advancement as it was intended.",
				"Heritage": "The CEF, being situated in Canada’s capital city, has a variety of attributes which constitute its tangible and intangible heritage. Originally situated on the urban edge of Ottawa, the Central Experimental Farm is now situated well within the urban boundary. Having been able to retain its 19th century landscape, the CEF could be considered a setting of co-evolution, where it has developed in tandem with the city of Ottawa and been able to keep its tangible heritage intact. In terms of intangible heritage, its landscape is another important feature to consider, having been modeled after a English aesthetic movement which took place in the 18th century whereby theorists and practitioners attempted to model landscape after an idealized vision of nature (think: William Cronon’s “The Trouble with Wilderness”). This can be reflected in the open cultivated fields and their various sizes, colors, textures, and seasonal variations. These features serve as a window into the 19th century philosophy of agriculture. Another important component of the landscape, in reference to its function as a place of scientific advancements in agriculture, is its neatness and tidiness. In terms of living heritage, the CEF is now the headquarters to a national network of experimental farms and serves to address national agricultural issues that may arise. Past inventions at the CEF have included the frostresistant and early-maturing Marquis wheat, which has helped transform the Canadian Praries into one of the world’s strongest grain-producing areas. Current research activities at the farm are oriented towards enhancing environmental performance and establishing sustainable ways to develop field crop. Thus, the living heritage can be described as a co-evolution of the CEF with the scientific demands of the era.",

				"History": "Prior to European colonization, the area was known as Wakesiah by the local Snuneymuxw, which translates to “far away.” in 1863, Captain Horace Douglas Lascelles bought 9000 acres in the Wakesiah area and formed the Harewood Coal Company. In the early 1900s, the area was largely rural agricultural land. Development of the region began in the 1940s–by the second half of the century, very little farmland remained as urbanization swept the area. The Five Acres Farm is one of the last remaining historical five-acre lots alluding to Nanaimo’s unique mining heritage.",
				"Heritage": "The Five Acre Farm is a remnant of one of British Columbia’s earliest planned settlements. Elements of intangible heritage can be found at the farm including an acreage, house, barn, outbuildings, and orchards. These remnants stand in stark contrast to the area surrounding it, which have largely been developed into single family lots.",
